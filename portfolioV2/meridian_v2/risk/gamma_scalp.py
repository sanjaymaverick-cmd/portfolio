"""Gamma scalping mechanics.

Textbook discrete hedge-and-rehedge loop. Math stays here. The UI only
sees finished numbers and plain sentences.

Daily PnL is one-day theta (time). Gamma Scalping PnL is the ½ Γ (ΔS)²
term for a chosen move. Long gamma can add extra profit if you keep
delta small. Short gamma does the opposite and can add extra loss.

This module never sends an order.
